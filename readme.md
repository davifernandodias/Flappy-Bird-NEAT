>  Info project

The Flappy Bird game is a classic in which the player controls a bird that flies between green tubes, trying to avoid collisions. In this project, we implemented a version of the game and trained an artificial intelligence agent using reinforcement learning algorithms to play the game autonomously.

## Functionalities

- Functional Flappy Bird game.
- Artificial intelligence agent trained to play automatically.
- User-friendly graphical interface.

## Technologies Used

- Python üêç
- Pygame (for game implementation)
- Machine learning libraries for training.
- Using NEAT method.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/davifernandodias/Flappy-Bird-NEAT.git
